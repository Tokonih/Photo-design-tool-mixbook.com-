# Photo-design-tool-mixbook.com-
This week i focused on creating an Internet-based photo design tool and photo product service and i used mixbook.com as my case study. I was able to recreate the frontend, although setting up the video was a bit challenging but i was able to achieve that. I built this frontend using HTML and CSS only.
